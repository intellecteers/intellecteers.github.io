The COVID-19 pandemic has caused several shifts to Illinois and the US. To keep up with the constant changes, plans for recovery in Illinois have been formed, the CDC guidelines and government rules have changed, and death rates are increasing.

As of last Tuesday, J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, announced several key updates about the ‘recovery’ of illinois. This update included a new five phased plan to re-open Illinois.

<br>
“The five-phase plan is guided by public health metrics designed to provide a framework for reopening businesses, education, and recreational activities in each phase. This initial plan can and will be updated as research and science develop and as the potential for effective treatments or vaccines is realized,” the governor's office released this statement on Tuesday.

The five phases will gradually re-open certain regions of Illinois that the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) have deemed able to be reopened. Pritzker will be working alongside the IDPH guidelines as well, to ensure the safety of Illinois.

“We believe that we are in phase two now,” mayor Lori Lightfoot of Chicago stated in a briefing earlier today. This phase includes Non-essential businesses open for pickup and several outside activities reopening like golf courses, boating, and fishing.
Alongside the five phase plan, the statewide Stay at Home order will be extended to May 29th or until further notice. The new statewide Stay at Home order has lighter restrictions than the previous order, allowing residents of Illinois to go to Essential Services, Essential Governmental Functions, or to operate Essential Businesses and Operations.

More people have gotten diagnosed and there is a high death rate. In Illinois just above 3,100 people have died and collectively 70,800 have gotten diagnosed with COVID-19. With the majority of cases within Cook county. Although the curve in Illinois has begun to flatten, the risk of COVID-19 spreading still stands. In zip code 60010, only 54 cases have been confirmed.

In response to this, new rules have been set when going out in public, a mask must be worn when going into a public facility such as a grocery store, restaurant, hardware store etc. 
“When venturing out for essential services, the governor’s order requires people older than 2 years of age to wear a face covering anytime they are unable to maintain 6 feet from others,” Pritzkers order states. 
As no cure or treatments have been approved yet, there are many guidelines suggested to help prevent the spread of corona, which can be all found on the IDPH website. https://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19
